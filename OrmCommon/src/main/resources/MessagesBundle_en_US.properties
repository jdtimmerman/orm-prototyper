## QUESTION
q_help_short			= ?

# Elementary fact question

ef_state_fact			= <html>State a fact</html>
ef_help					= <html> \
	<p>An elementary fact states one single fact.</p> \
	<p>Objects are 'things' and they are stated with a capital. All other words are attributed to the relation between the objects</p> \
	<p><strong>Examples</strong><br> \
	Person has Firstname<br> \
	Student receives Grade for Course \
	</p></html>
ef_alter_fact			= <html>Edit the current selected facttype</html>

# Totality constraint

tc_is_mandatory			= <html><em>Must</em> this object always occur in the following relation</html>
tc_no_facts				= <html>This object does not occur in any facts.</html>
tc_help					= <html> <p>The totality constraint can be considered as a mandatory constraint. It indicates whether an object <em>must</em> participate in a certain fact.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong><br>An object "Person" should always be involved in the role "Person has LastName", since every person has a last name.</p> </html> 

# Unicity constraint
uc_possible				= Allowed?
uc_is_unique			= <html>Given that the first line is accepted. Which of the following lines should be allowed.</html>
uc_help					= <html> \
	<p>An uncicity constraint indicates which value (or combination of) in a fact type should be unique.</p><br /> \
	<p><strong>Example</strong> <br /> \
	Consider that a person has one last name and can have multiple first names. \
	<table> \
	<tr><th>Person</th><th>First name</th><th>Valid?</th></tr> \
	<tr><td>1</td><td>Jan</td><td></td></tr> \
	<tr><td>1</td><td>Kees</td><td>Yes, because someone can have multiple first names</td></tr> \
	<tr><td>2</td><td>Jan</td><td>Yes, because several people can have the same first name</td></tr>\
	</table><table> \
	<tr><th>Person</th><th>Last name</th><th>Valid?</th></tr> \
	<tr><td>1</td><td>Klaassen</td><td></td></tr> \
	<tr><td>1</td><td>Janssen</td><td>No, because a person can have only one last name</td></tr> \
	<tr><td>2</td><td>Klaassen</td><td>Yes, because several people can have the same last name</td></tr> \
	</table></p>  \
	<p>An example population can be used in this dialog by selecting an object type and suplying some example. Otherwise this application will make up some examples.</p> \
