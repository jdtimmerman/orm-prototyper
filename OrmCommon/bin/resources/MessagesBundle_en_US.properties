# Elementary fact question

ef_state_fact			= <html>State a fact</html>
ef_help					= <html> \
	<p>An elementary fact states one single fact.</p> \
	<p>Objects are 'things' and they are stated with a capital. All other words are attributed to the relation between the objects</p> \
	<p><strong>Examples</strong><br> \
	Person has Firstname<br> \
	Student receives Grade for Course \
	</p></html>
ef_alter_fact			= <html>Edit the current selected facttype</html>

# Totality constraint

tc_is_mandatory			= <html><em>Must</em> this object always occur in the following relation</html>
tc_no_facts				= <html>This object does not occur in any facts.</html>
tc_help					= <html> \
	<p>The totality constraint can be considered as a mandatory constraint. It indicates whether an object <em>must</em> participate in a certain fact.</p> \
	<p><strong>Example</strong><br>An object "Person" should always be involved in the role \"Person has LastName\", since every person has a last name.</p> \
	</html> 

# Unicity constraint
uc_possible				= Allowed?
uc_is_unique			= <html>Given that the first line is accepted. Which of the following lines should be allowed.</html>

# Sample data
sample					= Sample data
sample_provide			= <html>Please provide some samples for the selected objecttype.</html>
sample_help				= <html><p>Filling out samples can make it easier to determine unicityconstraints.</p></html>

# ValueType
vt_isValueType			= <html>This object is a valuetype</html>
vt_help					= <html><p>In contrast to ObjectTypes, ValueTypes don't represent 'things' but rather a property a thing can have.</p></html>
